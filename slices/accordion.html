      On average, about 170,000 strawberries are transported to Wimbledon each day during
      the tournament. It was this kind of strawberry that was first cultivated in Kent by
      Regan's great-grandfather, Bernard Champion, in 1893.

      It has also happened a number of times in the pre-tournament qualifier of the
      lowest-level events. Bill Scanlon had a golden second set in his win over Marcos
      Hocevar at the 1983 Delray Beach WCT event. Yaroslava Shvedova had a golden first
      set in her win over Sara Errani at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships.
